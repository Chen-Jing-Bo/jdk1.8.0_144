/**
 * An iterator for lists that allows the programmer
 * to traverse the list in either direction, modify
 * the list during iteration, and obtain the iterator's
 * current position in the list. A {@code ListIterator}
 * has no current element; its <I>cursor position</I> always
 * lies between the element that would be returned by a call
 * to {@code previous()} and the element that would be
 * returned by a call to {@code next()}.
 * An iterator for a list of length {@code n} has {@code n+1} possible
 * cursor positions, as illustrated by the carets ({@code ^}) below:
 * <PRE>
 *                      Element(0)   Element(1)   Element(2)   ... Element(n-1)
 * cursor positions:  ^            ^            ^            ^                  ^
 * </PRE>
 *
 * List的迭代器，允许程序员在list的任何方向遍历，在迭代时修改list，获取iterator的当前位置。
 * ListIterator没有没有current element；他的 游标通常在previous（）和next（）方法调用返回元素
 * 的之间。
 * 长度为n的list的iterator含有n+1的游标
 *
 *
 * Note that the {@link #remove} and {@link #set(Object)} methods are
 * <i>not</i> defined in terms of the cursor position;  they are defined to
 * operate on the last element returned by a call to {@link #next} or
 * {@link #previous()}.
 *
 * 注意remove（）和set（）方法不是根据游标位置定义的；他们是被定义
 * 操作调用next（）或则previous（）返回的最后一个元素
